# ASSIGNMENT 02 - MEDIOCRE TWITTER REPLICA

i had huge hopes for myself only for like 80% of my intended things to work <br>
this ended up being a much huger task than I planned or thought

[Live App](https://twitter-replica1.onrender.com/)

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Express.js, MongoDB, bcrypt, Passport/Passport-local, Multer for Image storing in DB, dotenv, express-session
- Frontend: Pure CSS like an insane person (though I had some help from Chatgpt to broken styling)

You have the ability for the following things
 - make a post 
 - like (but unfortunately only you can see your own likes)
 - login
 - register
 - [DID NOT IMPLEMENT] messaging
    - I had originally thought to add messaging after the socket.io presentation 
        but it became too time consuming to learn in depth the ins and out and implementing it
